Installation
============
1. Upload the plugin (unzipped) into `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin under the "Plugins" menu.
3. Create a page on your site for "sign up" (this page will be forwarded to when the form is just filled in, informs the users that they need to click on a link in the email.
4. Create a page on your site "confirmation" (thanking them for their enquiry, links to download etc).
5. After creating these, fill in the settings in the "Settings > WP Email Capture" page, making sure the URL of the "sign up" page is in the "Page to redirect to on sign up" text box and the "confirmation" page URL is in the "Page to redirect to on confirmation of email address" text box.

The form can be inserted into the site at any location. However, to put the form anywhere, insert the following code into your template

`<?php if (function_exists('wp_email_capture_form')) { wp_email_capture_form(); } ?>` 

If you want to insert the form within a page, insert into any post or page the string `[wp_email_capture_form]`. It will be replaced with a simple form.

You can also add a widget to any widget enabled area by going to Appearance > Widgets in the WordPress Administration.

Stylings
========
To style your form, you need to add to your CSS file the following ID declarations. `wp_email_capture` is for sidebar & template widgets, `wp_email_capture_2` is for on page forms.

```
#wp_email_capture
{

}
#wp_email_capture label.wp-email-capture-name
{

}
#wp_email_capture label.wp-email-capture-email
{

}
#wp_email_capture input.wp-email-capture-name
{

}
#wp_email_capture input.wp-email-capture-email
{

}
#wp_email_capture_2
{

}
#wp_email_capture_2 label.wp-email-capture-name
{

}
#wp_email_capture_2 label.wp-email-capture-email

}
#wp_email_capture_2 input.wp-email-capture-name
{

}
#wp_email_capture_2 input.wp-email-capture-email
{

}
```

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
Can I see/export/autoconfirm "Unverified" Email Addresses?
----------------------------------------------------------
No.

Why Not?
--------
In accordance with the CANSPAM act, I have hidden Unverified emails from view. They can not be seen. Sorry, but the temptation is too big to spam unverified emails. Hence the removal.

Can Registered Users access the "thank you" page after signup? They try signing up again and get a 'user has already been registered' error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes they can, however they can't go through the registration process. If you are using [WP Email Capture Premium](http://wpemailcapture.com/premium/?utm_source=faq&utm_medium=wordpressorgreadme&utm_campaign=wpemailcapture), you can send an autoresponder after signing up (which can contain a link to the "thank you" page). Alternatively, add a notice on your landing page to encourage users to bookmark the page.

I am Upgrading to WP Email Capture 2.3+, why has my WP Email Capture Sidebar Widget disappeared?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The WP Email Capture version 2.3 saw the introduction of multiple sidebar widgets. This was coded differently to the pre 2.3 WP Email Capture sidebar widget. As such you will have to recreate the sidebar widget. It's easy to do, but apologies for this - I am working on a fix!

Often My Email Is Going Into Spam, how can I stop this?
-------------------------------------------------------
The most likely cause is by putting an email address that doesn't exist in the "From Which Email Address". Please don't put a noreply@, as spam eats this up. Also, make sure your email address is from your server (rather than a @gmail/@hotmail/@yahoo email address). Finally, try improving your deliverability rate by sending your emails through SMTP using [WP Mail SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/).

Does this piece of software send out email?
-------------------------------------------
No. I feel that to do so would be counter productive, as sending out email could have a detrimental effect on your server. There are a number of services we recommend, such as Aweber, to send out lists built on WP Email Capture.

Does it work with Wordpress Multisite?
--------------------------------------
This plugin is unsupported for Wordpress Multisite. Some people have reported success in using it. Others haven't. I have been unable to figure out why (I've been unable to get it working for Wordpress Multisite).

For some reason, no emails are being sent. No errors either. What could be the issue? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is sometimes the case if your hosting (usually Godaddy) disables certain ways of sending mail. If you use [WP Mail SMTP](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/), you can send emails in a different way that works.

Does it work with [theme_name]?
-------------------------------
This plugin does use widgets, so probably yes :)

How do I include the name in my emails I send to people?
--------------------------------------------------------
Wherever you put in %NAME% (spelt exactly like that, uppercase as well), it will be replaced with the name given by the user.
