Installation
------------
1. Upload the plugin (unzipped) into `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin under the "Plugins" menu.
3. Create a page on your site for "sign up" (this page will be forwarded to when the form is just filled in, informs the users that they need to click on a link in the email.
4. Create a page on your site "confirmation" (thanking them for their enquiry, links to download etc).
5. After creating these, fill in the settings in the "Settings > WP Email Capture" page, making sure the URL of the "sign up" page is in the "Page to redirect to on sign up" text box and the "confirmation" page URL is in the "Page to redirect to on confirmation of email address" text box.

The form can be inserted into the site at any location. However, to put the form anywhere, insert the following code into your template

`<?php if (function_exists('wp_email_capture_form')) { wp_email_capture_form(); } ?>` 

If you want to insert the form within a page, insert into any post or page the string `[wp_email_capture_form]`. It will be replaced with a simple form.

You can also add a widget to any widget enabled area by going to Appearance > Widgets in the WordPress Administration.
